# Password Generator

A random password generator that works off of JavaScript to prompt the user for criteria to generate a password for their use. 

## How it works

* The program asks the user to enter a number of characters that they want but it must be between 8-128. Anything less or more will ask the user to choose again. 
* The program then asks whether the user would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers and/or special characters included in their password. 
* Then the password is randomized through math.random and include each perameter choosen based on that array. 

* The password should then generate into the textbox through the dom using append. --- This is not currently working and something I will work on learning.
